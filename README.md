Try Haskell Android app
=======================
This is an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.bneijt.tryhaskell) which aims to be a native version of
[tryhaskell.org](http://tryhaskell.org)

This initial release is very slim and only allows you to just fire
single lines of Haskell at tryhaskell.org.

The following list is an ordered collection of what still needs to be done

-   Add GPLv3 header to all sources and add a LICENSE file
-   Add a spinner or busy indicator for requests

Not planned
-   Add a lesson/lesson texts (Already done by [Learn Haskell Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.dreamland_swh.learnhaskell) )
