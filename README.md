This is an Android app which aims to be a native version of
[tryhaskell.org](http://tryhaskell.org)

This initial release is very slim and only allows you to just fire
single lines of Haskell at tryhaskell.org.

The following list is an ordered collection of what still needs to be done

-   Add GPLv3 header to all sources and add a LICENSE file
-   Add a spinner or busy indicator for requests
-   Add syntax highlighting to the responses
-   Add a lesson/lesson texts
-   See if we can get multple haskell lines to work, or have an easy way of editing previous lines

BUGS

- Add scrolling
- Suggestions are added twice
- Suggestions are white on white
